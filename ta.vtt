What does that mean, "You want more"?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.700
Am I not enough, or...?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.300
You are. You know you are.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.300
It's not what I meant.

Just... that it's time for a change.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.000
So you don't believe in us, in this?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.900
Just forget I said anything.

He does the same to my kids right before bedtime.

Well, we decided if you all wouldn't come to Houston,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
then Houston would come to New York.

Although why anyone would live in this city is beyond me.

Oh, no, I took care of it.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400
Marina, your sister and I did not drive three days so that you would have to pay for our meals.

You didn't have to drive, you know that, right?

There's a great Japanese place just opened up down the street.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.400
Sorry, you guys are going to have to go visit the Empire State Building without me.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400
There was a shooting at the Queens Museum, so I've got to get moving now.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.400
Well, Marina, don't worry about us.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.400
Daddy, why? Why do you insist on calling me Marina when you know my name is Nina?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.400
Well, you were my Marina when you left.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400
Daddy!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.400
Nina, you see, I can change.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.400
It's very impressive.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.400
Okay, we got this.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400
You sure?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400
It's going to be great. Come on.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.400

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400

[music]

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.400
I just got off the phone with Isabel.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400
The mayor himself reached out asking for our help finding these two shooters.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.400
We need to reassure the public they can go to a museum and not end up covered in pig blood like some reenactment of Carrie.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400
What do we know so far?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.400
All right, so we got Emma Culp, Trevor Allen, both 28, both from New York.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.400
They're climate change activists who belong to a group called Global Climate Fund.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.400
There are no strangers to public acts of defiance.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.400
Are they the ones that disrupted the performance of enemy of the people?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.400
Yes, they were also involved with the campus protests at Ridgewell College three weeks ago.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.400
So maybe the assault is a reaction, a payback for the shooting.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.400
A cell phone footage didn't catch them saying anything about retribution before the guard was shot.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.400
Maybe they didn't mean to shoot him.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.400
Yeah, they didn't take a weapon into the museum.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.400
Trevor also didn't leave the gun behind.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.400
Could be a sense of fatalism kicked in after the shooting like they have nothing left to lose.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400
We should be ready for anything with these two.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.400
So they went into Corona Park. Any eyes on them since?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.400
Uh, let's see.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.400
No, all the cameras in the park are down due to a recent update. Everything's offline.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.400
Their phones are off also.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.400
Are these two together? Trevor and Emma?

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.400
Maybe. I went through Emma's social media.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400
She was at Pride in June. She stands for "Love is Love."

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.400
Clearly she's never been divorced. Love is expensive.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.400
I mean, she might have a girlfriend too.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.400
Hmm. I wonder if she's loyal to Trevor.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400
One might flip on the other.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400
Hannah, does this Global Climate Front have an office or anything?

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.400
Yes. I tracked their headquarters to Brooklyn, not far from Emma's apartment.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.400
New Cycle's doing a hell of a job of boloing these two.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.400
You and I will go to their headquarters. Nina Ray, check on Emma's digs.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400
They're on their way.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.400
Hey, what's the latest with Barnes?

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400
She says she's back next week for sure.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.400
Okay. See you in the car.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.400
Okay.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.400
So I saw Emma leave this morning with that guy on the news.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.400
Thought maybe he spent the night. They went for a breakfast.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.400
Okay. Do we have a sense of the people in her life? Maybe who she's dating?

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.400
Everything's so fluid these days, right? Girls with girls, girls with guys, girls with girls and guys.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400
So that's a no.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.400
Well, the Trevor guy's the only person I've seen around here on the regular.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.400
Her fridge is full.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.400
Yeah, these are two and she has a suitcase in there.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.400
It doesn't look like she was going on the run that day.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.400
Well, they're definitely improvising and don't have a plan.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.400
Do we know what Emma did for employment?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.400
Internships mostly. Her and Trevor have a spotty employment record.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.400
Do you know if a trust fund pays the rent for this place?

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.400
So now get this. On the news, they say they're looking for an Emma Cope.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.400
But her rent checks always come from a Jefferies Corp.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.400
Jefferies Corporation.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.400
Yeah.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.400
All right, so there's a Jefferies family. They made most of the money in oil.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.400
Emma's father, Alexander Cope Jefferies, died two years ago.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.400
Okay, so her climate activist fugitive comes from oil money.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.400
Maybe she's trying to repay some common debt, use her inheritance to raise awareness for climate change.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.400
She goes by a different name to distance herself from her family. Wants to write her own history.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.400
Possibly. Thank you.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400
Yeah, sure.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:41.400
Trevor. Trevor! I really think we should turn in the gun.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.400
Explain what happened. That it was just an accident.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.400
Don't ever believe me, Adam. I'll go to jail for murder.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
You didn't mean to.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.400
I know that and you know that.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.400
All right, look, if you want to go home, go now.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.400
I'll head out on my own with this girl who's supposed to meet us to help get us out of the city.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:04.400
Tori?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.400
Yeah, yeah. Get in.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.400
All right, that's her. We'll be fine.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:20.400
Because if you come with me, you'll be in the fight of your life. Not just for me, but for all life.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.400
Or you can go back to the life that your father gave you.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.400
The one subsidized by the rape and murder of our planet.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:41.400
I'm coming with you.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.400
I'm coming with you.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:09:06.400
I mean, look, we want people to pay attention to global warming, to decrease the output of greenhouse gases so that our kids might have a chance at clean air

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.400
and a summer where the temperature isn't over a hundred fourteen days in a row.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400
But we do not believe in communicating our message with violence. It's in our charter.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.400
Yeah, we'll be taking this laptop.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.400
Have Trevor and Emma ever been violent in the past?

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:29.400
No, but Trevor has a temper. Emma's way more easygoing.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.400
So she's following his lead here.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
When was the last time you spoke to Emma or Trevor?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.400
This morning, before all hell broke loose.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:45.400
You planned for this chaos to deface the artwork with pig blood. Any other stunts we should know about? Norbert?

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.400
The vote next week to save the polar bears up in Alaska. We're considering a sit-in at the senator's house.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.400
Just a sit-in?

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.400
Yes.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.400
Do you think our fugitives are headed for D.C.?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:13.400
I think they're acting recklessly. They're young, armed and dangerous. That's a lethal combination.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:27.400
Well, I know it's not much, but this is where I grew up. Me and my main mom, and she rests in peace.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.400
Sorry for your lost, Tori.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400
She'd been sick for years.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.400
Everyone around these parts has been. I've had a thyroid problem my whole life.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.400
What is it, this disgusting water?

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.400
It's gotta be. We're on the Marcellus Shale deposit. Oil companies have been fracking this area for years.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.400
They should bleed us dry, get us sick and then leave. That's why I want to help you guys.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.400
I really believe in what you're doing, and I really think you didn't mean to shoot that guard.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.400
Thanks. I'm really glad you're on our team.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.400
I believe in you too.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:21.400
It's one of the companies that fractured your hand-stabbed gas and oil.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.400
Um, yeah, how'd you know?

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.400
Someone in their tanker truck's go by.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.400
See, there goes another one.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.400
You know, I've been noticing them the past couple days, but I don't know where they're going because all the wells around here are closed.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.400
So, what's the plan now?

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.400
I was thinking we'd stay here tonight, just lay low.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.400
Yeah? Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.400
Are you guys hungry? I could rest something up.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.400
Oh, that'd be great. Also, do you have a computer I can borrow?

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400
Yeah.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:00.400
Hey, I finally decoded the Global Climate Front's messaging system.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.400
Norbert lied to us. He had been in contact with Emma and Trevor.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.400
Just after the shooting, Trevor reached out to Norbert for help getting out of the city.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.400
Norbert then found someone to pick them up named Carbon Queen.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.400
She's offering sanctuary to our two fugitives. She says she'll pick them up wherever they want.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.400
So, Norbert arranged for Trevor and Carbon Queen to meet outside the PATH station in Jersey City.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.400
Yeah, I'm accessing the cameras now. What do you think, between one and two?

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.400
Yeah, sounds about right.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.400
Alright.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.400
There they are.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400
Got it.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.400
You're getting into a green Subaru. Run that plate.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.400
Okay, plates belong to a Tori Newell, 25. She lives in Clearville, Pennsylvania.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.400
Put a bottle out and let's get up on our phone.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.400
I'll have Norbert arrested for aiding and abetting.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.400
Pack a small bag. We're going to Pennsylvania, my people.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:15.400
Nice dress.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:22.400
[Music]

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.400
I was up until three in the morning. Kind of 14 tankers go by.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.400
When I looked up HENCEP gas and oil, I found this.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:37.400
They're building a pipeline for liquid CO2.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.400
I haven't seen any pipelines around here. What's it for?

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.400
It's called carbon capture. They take all the byproducts and drill it and they pump them into the ground.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.400
Supposedly a good thing, but the reason it's taken so long is this stuff is totally dangerous and bad for the environment.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.400
Is that what's in those trucks?

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.400
I don't know.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400
Well, where's the pipeline?

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.400
Don't know that either. But I know how we could find out.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:19.400
[Music]

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.400
Hey. You okay?

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.400
No, it's my ankle. I think it's broken. We were riding bikes and I fell off.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.400
Bikes? I don't see any.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400
Nice and easy.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.400
I just want to take a ride in your truck.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:43.400
Stop! Stop!

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.400
[Screams]

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.400
What are you doing? You were not supposed to shoot him.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.400
I didn't have a choice.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.400
Oh my God, I think he's dead.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.400
We're all dying, Tori.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.400
Hence that's been killing people with their poison for years.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.400
You of all people should know that.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.400
Come on! We gotta get out of here!

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.400
And go where? We don't even know where the pipeline is now.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.400
He's got a GPS. We'll figure it out.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.400
You coming?

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.400
I'll go if you will.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400
Come on.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:51.400
Hey. I've got an aerial here of Tori Newell's farmhouse.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.400
Looks like clear sightlines from any approach.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.400
Yeah, except there on the south side. The topography may give us some cover.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.400
Reach out to troupas for backup.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400
On it.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.400
Okay, the farmhouse is on Marcellus Shale. Most of the property is.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.400
That land's been fract within an inch of its life.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.400
Which is probably why Tori was so keen to help Trevor and Emma.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.400
They're on their way. Sorry, give me one minute.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.400
Hey, Stuart. What's going on?

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.400
I give up. Like I surrender.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.400
Oh boy, what's happening?

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.400
You're dad. Like he won't let me pay for anything.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.400
He keeps trying to slip money into people's hands.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.400
I don't get it. Like who does that?

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.400
Yeah, I mean that's just dad.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.400
Yeah, well I mean more than that, he keeps smoking.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.400
Like every 15 minutes we gotta stop so we can smoke.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.400
It's New York City. There's no place to smoke anymore.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.400
Can Tink help at all?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.400
I mean she offered to take him to a matinee at the Lion King, but you know what?

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.400
She knows full well that they're gonna have to leave 10 minutes in,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.400
'cause he's gotta go smoke.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.400
Let me scout. When?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.400
We're on our way.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.400
Our climate activist just hijacked an oil tanker truck.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.400
Driver's dead. Let's roll.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.400
Hey, sorry, I gotta go.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.400
You know what? Take dad to Central Park.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.400
They have penguins and that will entertain him. He loves them.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.400
Okay, I'll run up by Tink. I love you.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.400
Love you too.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.400
What's it say?

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.400
Tank capacity 6,000 gallons of carbon dioxide.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.400
6,000? That's insane.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.400
Yeah, contains gas under pressure, may explode if heated,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.400
may displace oxygen and cause rapid suffocation.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.400
But there's oxygen masks in the jockey box.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.400
Where's that GPS say this rig was headed?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.400
Something called a transfer station, whatever that is.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:44.400
Emma, take a picture of that map.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.400
We got cops on our tail. Oh, oh, my God.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.400
Clear vehicle to the side.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.400
They want us to pull over.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.400
I know they do.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.400
But we cannot run them in this heat. Let me think.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.400
Clear vehicle over now.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.400
Clear down.

Tori, where are you?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.400
I don't know. I don't even know.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.400
Driver of the vehicle, stop the engine.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.400
Tori, Tori, I need you.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.400
Now exit the vehicle one at a time, nice and slow, hands in the air.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.400
Tori, look at me. It has to be you.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.400
None of us can go out there.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.400
Okay, okay, okay. I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.400
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.400
Face down on the ground! Okay, okay, okay, okay.

According to the company,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.400
6,000 gallons of compressed carbon dioxide.

I'm pushing the accelerator, but I have no power.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.400
It's the CO2.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.400
It eliminates oxygen so the engine can't combust.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.400

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.400
Cover me!

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.400
[shouting]

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.400
We need to help these people!

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.400
Grab your masks!

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.400
Ray!

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.400
See if we can stop that steve!

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.400
[coughing]

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.400
[shouting]

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:24.400
[shouting]

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.400
[coughing]

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.400
Cover your mouth.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.400
One second, one second.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.400
Come, come this way.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400
[shouting]

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:40.400
Let's go, let's run!

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.400
[coughing]

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.400
Come, come, come, let's go.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.400
Help! Please help us!

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.400
Please help us, please!

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.400
Hurry, please!

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.400
[coughing]

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.400
[shouting]

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.400
[shouting]

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.400
There's a guy over there, throw him in!

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.400
[shouting]

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:10.400
I need help!

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.400
Please help!

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.400
I can't get her to wake up!

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.400
Please hurry, hurry her!

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.400
She's not moving!

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.400
[crying]

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.400
Please!

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.400
[coughing]

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:30.400
[coughing]

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.400
Clouds dissipated.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.400
We got no fatalities, which is a minor miracle.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.400
What about the trooper that was shot?

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.400
He's gonna make it too. You good?

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.400
Yeah.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.400
Look who we found hiding in the parking lot.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.400
Toy? It was so scary.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.400
Where are they going? I don't know.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.400
Cover. Oh my god, you're arresting me?

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.400
Yeah, you helped out two fugitives.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.400
You'll be helping yourself stay out of prison if you tell us where they're going.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.400
Okay, it's just Trevor, it's not Emma, they're looking for the pipeline.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.400
What pipeline?

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.400
And Steph has a CO2 pipeline around here.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.400
I don't know, I don't know.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.400
That's why Trevor wanted to kidnap the truck driver so that we could find out where he was going.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:16.400
Two people matching Trevor and Emma's description just hijacked a raft for it from a white female.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.400
Yeah, Walmart parking lot 12 miles away.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.400
Check it out.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.400
Sit on that curb and don't say a word, I'm not done with you.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.400
Okay, she's not wrong.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.400
Hen's step have just opened a CO2 pipeline that went online a week ago.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.400
Then we need to get them to shut it down.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.400
It could be Trevor and Emma's next target.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.400
Where's their HQ?

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.400
It's north in El Tuna on Highway 220.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.400
Text me the address and grill the hell out of her.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.400
I don't know anything else, I swear.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.400
Guess what, I don't believe a word that comes out of your mouth.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.400
Call me if you hear anything from Ray or Nina.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.400
Do you know how long it took us to get that thing up and running?

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.400
Seven years.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.400
I'm not shutting it down now based on a hunch.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.400
It's more than a hunch, we know our two fugitives are targeting your pipeline.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.400
Where?

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.400
Don't know yet.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.400
It's over 70 miles long, Agent Scott.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.400
Except for the part over near Everett that's still under construction.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.400
Is that what you're talking about?

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.400
It's just temporary until we finish.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.400
We're really doing the residents here a favor with our carbon capture.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.400
What are you getting some kind of tax break for all this?

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.400
Damn right.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.400
It's called a 45Q, and after all the money we've invested,

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.400
I need this pipeline to be operational before the whole company goes under.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.400
You know what happens if they blow that pipeline, right?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.400
Lots of people will die.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.400
My hands are really tied here.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.400
Where are your priorities, man?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.400
If you don't shut down the pipeline,

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.400
you're not going to get your hands on the pipeline.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.400
You're going to get your hands on the pipeline.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.400
Where are your priorities, man?

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.400
If you don't shut that pipeline down,

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.400
you think Exxon Valdez was bad?

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.400
Exxon survived significant challenges, and so will we.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.400
Look, I'll get these photos over to our security team

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.400
and make sure everyone's aware of the threat.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.400
I'm sorry,

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.400
but I'm not going to be intimidated by a bunch of pissant eco-terrorists.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.400
Show me the map of the pipeline.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.400
What?

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.400
I'm done playing with you.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.400
Show me the map!

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.400
[music]

00:24:54.400 --> 00:25:12.400
A white buffalo was born at Yellowstone.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.400
White buffalo?

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.400
Yeah, it's a sign that the Earth is at a crossroads.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.400
What is that?

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.400
Kind of dancing with wolves thing?

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.400
Tatanka, tatanka!

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.400
It's Lakota.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.400
Jeez.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.400
It's a sign that there's hope,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.400
but that more must be done to protect the Earth.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.400
Huh.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.400
Well,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.400
then I'd say that

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.400
this white buffalo's right on time.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:46.400
Look at how much we've accomplished so far.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.400
Two people are dead because of us.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.400
And they've brought attention to us.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.400
To our mission.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.400
Over the news, everyone's talking about us.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.400
Don't you see how great that is?

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.400
How else are we going to change the world?

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.400
Save the world.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.400
You see it, right?

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.400
Violence is the answer.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.400
Why else

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.400
was that baby white buffalo born today?

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.400
Right now.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.400
If not a sign that we are on the right path.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.400
Yeah, I guess so.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.400
Emma?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:30.400
Do you pledge allegiance to our planet?

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.400
To the destruction of companies

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.400
who will rape and murder her?

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.400
I do.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.400
I do too.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.400
Emma.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.400
Emma.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:52.400
None of you are the world's attention.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.400
Let's show them how dangerous

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.400
these pipelines really are.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.400
How?

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.400
Remember what that warning on the truck visor said?

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.400
Danger.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.400
If heated, might explode.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.400
So we're going to heat up the pipeline?

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.400
And take a picture of the GPS

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.400
so we know where the transfer station is.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.400
Everything else we need we have right here.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:24.400
Anna, you hear anything?

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.400
Hey, we just got back.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.400
Look, no cameras in the Walmart parking lot,

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.400
but a witness did see Emma and Trevor.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.400
I got something from Tori though.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.400
She said that Emma took a picture of the GPS

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.400
in the truck and it was heading to a transfer station

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.400
on the pipeline.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.400
I checked it myself and there it was.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.400
I've alerted the state police that that's where

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.400
Emma and Trevor are probably heading.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.400
Maybe, but I'm more worried about the injection well.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.400
How come?

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.400
It's where the pipeline terminates. All the CO2 in the line

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.400
gets injected underground into the old shale formations

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.400
for storage.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.400
How much CO2 are we talking?

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.400
Hundreds of thousands of gallons, all under high pressure.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.400
If they blow it there, it's just not the pipeline

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.400
that goes. It could be the whole damn county.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.400
So what's the plan?

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.400
Let's put up. Bray, Hannah, take the transfer station.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.400
Nina and I will take the injection well.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.400
I'm ready people. Let's move.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:22.400
Hey there.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.400
Agent Hannah Gibson.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.400
Officer Jackson.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.400
Yeah, Agent Ray Cannon.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.400
So what we got here?

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.400
What's going on around this room?

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.400
I haven't seen anything.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.400
And you sent anyone out?

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.400
I'm controlling the area. I haven't seen anyone.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.400
Okay, cool.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.400
This is where that tanker was headed.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.400
But the police.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.400
Emma, you know, obviously this isn't gonna work.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:54.400
Change of plans.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.400
Let's see where this pipeline ends.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.400
Why? It's gotta go underground somewhere

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.400
in this whole point of carbon capture.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.400
It's a better target than this ever was.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.400
Trevor, are you serious?

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.400
Grab a gas can. Let's go.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.400
Trevor!

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.400
This will be our coup de grace.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.400
This is why we put on this earth, Emma.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.400
We'll go through the woods.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.400
Once we're out of sight, we'll cross over.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:30.400
What is this?

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.400
I don't know.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.400
Well, are there even two ends to this stupid thing?

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.400
Emma, I didn't design it. I don't know.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.400
Can we take a break?

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.400
These things are really heavy.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.400
Yeah.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.400
I gotta go to the bathroom.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.400
Trevor, just pee right here.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.400
I don't have to pee.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.400
You okay, young lady?

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.400
Yeah. Sorry, I was just out for a hike

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.400
and I guess I got lost.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.400
Are those yours?

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.400
What?

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.400
The gas cans.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.400
Why are you here?

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.400
I'm here to see Trevor.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.400
You're not alone.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.400
I'm here to see Trevor.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.400
I'm here to see Trevor.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.400
I'm here to see Trevor.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.400
I'm here to see Trevor.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.400
I'm here to see Trevor.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.400
Why are you here?

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.400
Wait.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.400
You're her. The girl in the picture.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.400
Stay right where you are.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.400
Stop right there. Don't turn around. Go to the ground.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.400
Gee, I'm holstered up by the injection well.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.400
Radio 2.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.400
Where does this pipeline end?

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.400
Back that way. Four miles.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.400
Where does that one go?

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.400
None of your business.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.400
You think I'm messing around?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.400
Okay, please, please, okay. I have a son.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400
Then answer the question.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.400
Which of these pipelines leads to the end?

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.400
This one.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.400
Back at the injection well.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:10.400
We'll take that one.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.400
Grab the gas cans.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.400
Go.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.400
Start walking.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.400
Start walking.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.400
Get moving.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.400
Get moving.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.400
Let's go.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.400
Chief, this is Smolin. FBI's here.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.400
Copy.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:36.400
Hey, Agent Chase, Agent Scott.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.400
I'm all Smolin. Heard you were coming.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.400
Did you see the injection well?

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.400
I thought it'd be bigger.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.400
Is it operational?

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.400
Yes, ma'am. Went online two weeks ago.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.400
How come the pressure valve says zero and I don't hear anything?

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.400
I don't know.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.400
Management handles all that. I'm just security.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.400
Can I call my boss? Why don't you do that, Miles?

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400
Chief, this is Smolin.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.400
FBI's down here asking about the pipeline.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.400
If it's turned on.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.400
Chief, do you copy?

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.400
That's weird. What?

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.400
Tried to reach him a few minutes ago, but he didn't answer then either.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.400
Where is he?

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.400
Out patrolling the pipeline. Campbell's orders.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.400
Talk to me, Ray.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.400
Hey, look, Emma and Trevor were here at the transfer station.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.400
We did a perimeter search and we found the Toyota.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.400
Any idea which direction they went?

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.400
No. State police didn't see either of them.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.400
All right, hang on a sec.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:34.400
It's seven miles from the transfer station to the injection well.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.400
Assuming that they're tracking the pipeline,

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.400
they should be somewhere in between.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.400
On foot and armed?

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.400
We're leaving now. You should do the same.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.400
We'll meet in the middle and box them in.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.400
Copy that.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.400
Come on. I'm taking your Jeep.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:33:00.400
Is your boss's Jeep?

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400
Yes, sir.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.400
Anything?

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.400
No, nothing. You?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.400
Where's this go?

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.400
I don't know.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.400
What do you mean you don't know?

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.400
Look, I'm sorry I never come down here and I've never seen it before.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.400
Only the chief patrols this area.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.400
It's not on the map.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.400
Radio the other state police and tell them to get the hell down here.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.400
Unbelievable.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400
Are you pumping CO2 into this well?

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.400
I don't know.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.400
I'm not sure.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.400
You're fracking with CO2.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.400
I don't know what the...

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.400
What are you talking about?

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.400
Usually they frack these wells with water and a bunch of chemicals.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.400
But if they're using CO2 here,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.400
it's gotta be way worse.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.400
It's gotta be way worse.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.400
Is that even legal?

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.400
I don't know anything about it.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.400
Mr. Campbell told me to keep this place a secret.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.400
Hell yeah he did.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.400
There's no way they have a permit for this.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.400
[music]

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:24.400
This is a gift, Emma.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.400
This is what we're gonna set on fire.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.400
No! We'll all die!

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.400
Baby...

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.400
We cannot do that.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.400
What happens if it explodes?

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:40.400
Catastrophic.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.400
Come on.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.400
Alright.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.400
Let's build this fire.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.400
Trevor, I can't.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.400
We got this, Emma.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.400
Just keep the gun on him.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.400
Shoot him if he tries anything.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:02.400
That boy's crazy.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.400
He gonna get us all killed.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.400
He gonna get you killed.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.400
Sorry.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.400

What are you doing?

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400
I'm not doing the same of you. This is an innocent man here.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.400
Killing him is not going to save the planet.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.400
At least his death will be linked to me.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.400
To what I believe in.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.400
That these pipelines, the drilling, the fracking

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.400
is causing our planet to burn up.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.400
I'm just as worried about all this as you are, Emma.

Your generation has left a mess for mine.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.400
It died.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.400
The Earth is doomed.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.400
You really believe that?

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.400
You wouldn't be fighting so hard to save it?

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:18.400
Emma.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.400
You can do a lot more alive than you can dead.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:28.400
I know your family made its money in oil.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.400
But you can carve out a different identity for yourself.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:36.400
Yes, you can.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.400
Away from your father, away from it all.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.400
You can put an end to oil wells like this.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.400
Violence isn't the answer. Just hand me the gun.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:54.400
It's over.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.400
Come on.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.400
[crying]

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:12.400
You're under arrest for domestic terrorism

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.400
and accomplished a murder.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.400
Let's go, Patty Hearst.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.400
[crying]

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:32.400
What is this exactly?

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.400
Salmon sushi.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.400
How do they go past?

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.400
It's delicious, Daddy. Try it.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400
You eat fish all the time.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.400
Just try it. Here.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.400
Come on.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.400
I ordered that wagyu.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.400
When is that going to get here?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.400
Oh, not soon enough.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.400
So it's too bad your boyfriend couldn't make it.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.400
That silver spoon thinks he's too good for us, Tink.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.400
No, he doesn't.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.400
You barely even know him.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.400
Oh, right.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400
He gave you that big black credit card

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.400
so you could pay for all of it.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.400
Which was very kind of him.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.400
So when are you all getting married?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.400
Oh, we aren't.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.400
Oh?

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.400
Yeah, we're happy with the way things are.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.400
Oh.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.400
Little Dougie's last name is going to be Chase Scola.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.400
Mm-hmm.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.400
It'll be a hard time getting that on the back of a football jersey, huh?

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.400
Maybe it won't go on the back of a football jersey.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400
What?

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.400
I don't know.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.400
Who knows what Dougie's going to want to do, Dad?

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.400
I don't want him to get a TBI.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.400
Or do anything like the way that I grew up.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.400
What exactly was wrong with the way you grew up, Marina?

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.400
Nina, please, Daddy.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.400
Everything.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.400
Everything was wrong with the way I grew up.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.400
I couldn't get away from home fast enough.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.400
I gave you a good life.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.400
Keep telling yourself that.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.400
Keep telling yourself it was a great life, Dad.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.400
Well, I want a different life for my son,

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.400
and I am damned to die.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.400
I'm going to die.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.400
Come on, Tink.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.400
I said come on, Tink!

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:50.400
I'm so sorry.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.400
You know, this is

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.400
just all going to blow over.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.400
Yeah, I'm okay

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.400
if it doesn't.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.400
[music]

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.400
[music]

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.400
[music]

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:52.400

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.400
