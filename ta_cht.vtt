What do we know so far?

So maybe the assault is a reaction, a payback for the shooting.
所以也許這次襲擊是一種反應，是對槍擊事件的報復。

Trevor also didn't leave the gun behind.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.400
Could be a sense of fatalism kicked in after the shooting like they have nothing left to lose.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400

I mean, she might have a girlfriend too.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.400
Hmm. I wonder if she's loyal to Trevor.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400

So I saw Emma leave this morning with that guy on the news.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.400
Thought maybe he spent the night. They went for a breakfast.
以为他可能在她那儿过夜了。他们一起去吃了早餐。

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.400
Okay. Do we have a sense of the people in her life? Maybe who she's dating?
好的。我们对她的生活中的人有了解吗？也许她在和谁约会？

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.400
Everything's so fluid these days, right? Girls with girls, girls with guys, girls with girls and guys.
現在一切都這麼流動，對吧？女孩和女孩在一起，女孩和男孩在一起，女孩和女孩和男孩在一起。

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400
So that's a no.

It doesn't look like she was going on the run that day.

Well, they're definitely improvising and don't have a plan.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.400
Do we know what Emma did for employment?
我們知道艾瑪做什麼工作嗎？

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.400
Internships mostly. Her and Trevor have a spotty employment record.
主要是實習。她和特雷弗的工作記錄都不太穩定。

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.400
Do you know if a trust fund pays the rent for this place?
你知道這個地方的租金是由信託基金支付的嗎？

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.400
So now get this. On the news, they say they're looking for an Emma Cope.
所以現在聽好了。新聞上說他們在找一個叫艾瑪·科普的人。

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.400
But her rent checks always come from a Jefferies Corp.
但她的租金支票總是來自傑弗里斯公司。

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.400
Jefferies Corporation.
傑弗里斯公司。

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.400
Yeah.
是的。

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.400
All right, so there's a Jefferies family. They made most of the money in oil.
好吧，所以有一個傑弗里斯家族。他們的大部分錢都是從石油中賺來的。

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.400
Emma's father, Alexander Cope Jefferies, died two years ago.
艾瑪的父親，亞歷山大·科普·傑弗里斯，兩年前去世了。

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.400
Okay, so her climate activist fugitive comes from oil money.
好吧，所以她這個氣候活動家的逃犯來自石油財富。

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.400
Maybe she's trying to repay some common debt, use her inheritance to raise awareness for climate change.
也許她試圖償還一些共同的債務，用她的遺產來提高對氣候變化的認識。

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.400
She goes by a different name to distance herself from her family. Wants to write her own history.
她用不同的名字來與家人保持距離。想要寫下自己的歷史。

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.400
Possibly. Thank you.
可能吧。謝謝。

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400
Yeah, sure.
是的，當然。

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:41.400
Trevor. Trevor! I really think we should turn in the gun.
特雷弗。特雷弗！我真的認為我們應該把槍交出來。

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.400
Explain what happened. That it was just an accident.
解釋發生了什麼。那只是個意外。

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.400
Don't ever believe me, Adam. I'll go to jail for murder.
永遠不要相信我，亞當。我會因為謀殺而入獄。

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
You didn't mean to.
你不是故意的。

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.400
I know that and you know that.
我知道這一點，你也知道這一點。

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.400
All right, look, if you want to go home, go now.
好吧，聽著，如果你想回家，現在就走。

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.400
I'll head out on my own with this girl who's supposed to meet us to help get us out of the city.
我會和這個應該來幫助我們離開城市的女孩一起獨自出發。

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:04.400

Yeah, yeah. Get in.
是的，是的。上車。

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.400
All right, that's her. We'll be fine.
好的，就是她了。我们会没事的。

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:20.400
Because if you come with me, you'll be in the fight of your life. Not just for me, but for all life.
因为如果你跟我一起，你将会面临一生中最激烈的战斗。不仅仅是为了我，而是为了所有的生命。

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.400
Or you can go back to the life that your father gave you.
或者你可以回到你父亲给你的那种生活。

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.400
The one subsidized by the rape and murder of our planet.
那种建立在掠夺和毁灭我们星球之上的生活。

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:41.400
I'm coming with you.
我跟你一起走。

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.400
I'm coming with you.
我跟你一起走。

00:08:43.400 --> 00:09:06.400
I mean, look, we want people to pay attention to global warming, to decrease the output of greenhouse gases so that our kids might have a chance at clean air
我的意思是，看，我们希望人们关注全球变暖，减少温室气体的排放，这样我们的孩子或许还有机会呼吸到干净的空气，

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.400
and a summer where the temperature isn't over a hundred fourteen days in a row.
并且度过一个气温不会连续114天超过某个极限的夏天。

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400
But we do not believe in communicating our message with violence. It's in our charter.
但我们不相信用暴力来传达我们的信息。这是我们的章程。

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.400
Yeah, we'll be taking this laptop.
是的，我们会带走这台笔记本电脑。

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.400
Have Trevor and Emma ever been violent in the past?
特雷弗和艾玛过去有过暴力行为吗？

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:29.400
No, but Trevor has a temper. Emma's way more easygoing.
没有，但特雷弗脾气不好。艾玛则随和得多。

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.400
So she's following his lead here.
所以这次她是跟着他的节奏走。

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
When was the last time you spoke to Emma or Trevor?
你最后一次和艾玛或特雷弗说话是什么时候？

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.400
This morning, before all hell broke loose.
今天早上，在所有事情失控之前。

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:45.400
You planned for this chaos to deface the artwork with pig blood. Any other stunts we should know about? Norbert?
你策划了这场混乱，用猪血玷污了艺术品。还有其他我们应该知道的把戏吗，诺伯特？

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.400
The vote next week to save the polar bears up in Alaska. We're considering a sit-in at the senator's house.
下周关于拯救阿拉斯加北极熊的投票。我们正在考虑在参议员家静坐。

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.400
Just a sit-in?
只是静坐吗？

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.400
Yes.
是的。

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.400
Do you think our fugitives are headed for D.C.?
你觉得我们的逃犯会去华盛顿特区吗？

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:13.400
I think they're acting recklessly. They're young, armed and dangerous. That's a lethal combination.
我认为他们行事鲁莽。他们年轻、持械且危险。这是致命的组合。

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:27.400
Well, I know it's not much, but this is where I grew up. Me and my main mom, and she rests in peace.
我知道这不算什么，但这是我长大的地方。我和我的主母，她安息了。

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.400
Sorry for your lost, Tori.
为你的失去感到抱歉，托里。

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400
She'd been sick for years.

Everyone around these parts has been. I've had a thyroid problem my whole life.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.400
What is it, this disgusting water?
这是什么，这恶心的水？

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.400
It's gotta be. We're on the Marcellus Shale deposit. Oil companies have been fracking this area for years.
肯定是。我们在马塞勒斯页岩沉积层上。石油公司多年来一直在这里进行水力压裂。

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.400
They should bleed us dry, get us sick and then leave. That's why I want to help you guys.
他们应该榨干我们，让我们生病然后离开。这就是为什么我想帮助你们。

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.400
I really believe in what you're doing, and I really think you didn't mean to shoot that guard.
我真的相信你们在做的事，也真的认为你们不是故意射杀那个警卫的。

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.400
Thanks. I'm really glad you're on our team.
谢谢。真的很高兴你能加入我们的团队。

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.400
I believe in you too.
我也相信你。

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:21.400
It's one of the companies that fractured your hand-stabbed gas and oil.
这是其中一家公司，他们破坏了你的手工开采的天然气和石油。

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.400
Um, yeah, how'd you know?
嗯，是的，你怎么知道的？

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.400
Someone in their tanker truck's go by.
他们的油罐车有人经过。

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.400
See, there goes another one.
看，又有一辆过去了。

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.400
You know, I've been noticing them the past couple days, but I don't know where they're going because all the wells around here are closed.
你知道，我过去几天一直在注意它们，但我不知道它们要去哪里，因为这里所有的油井都关闭了。

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.400
So, what's the plan now?
那么，现在计划是什么？

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.400
I was thinking we'd stay here tonight, just lay low.
我在想我们今晚留在这里，低调一点。

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.400

Are you guys hungry? I could rest something up.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.400
Oh, that'd be great. Also, do you have a computer I can borrow?
哦，那太好了。还有，你有电脑可以借我用一下吗？

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400
Yeah.
有的。

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:00.400
Hey, I finally decoded the Global Climate Front's messaging system.
嘿，我终于解码了全球气候阵线的通讯系统。

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.400
Norbert lied to us. He had been in contact with Emma and Trevor.
诺伯特对我们撒谎了。他一直在与艾玛和特雷弗联系。

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.400
Just after the shooting, Trevor reached out to Norbert for help getting out of the city.
就在枪击事件发生后，特雷弗联系诺伯特寻求帮助离开城市。

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.400
Norbert then found someone to pick them up named Carbon Queen.
诺伯特随后找到了一位名叫碳皇后的人来接他们。

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.400
She's offering sanctuary to our two fugitives. She says she'll pick them up wherever they want.
她为我们的两位逃亡者提供庇护。她说她会在他们想要的任何地方接他们。

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.400
So, Norbert arranged for Trevor and Carbon Queen to meet outside the PATH station in Jersey City.
于是，诺伯特安排特雷弗和碳皇后在泽西市的PATH车站外见面。

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.400
Yeah, I'm accessing the cameras now. What do you think, between one and two?
是的，我现在正在访问摄像头。你觉得，大概在一点到两点之间？

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.400
Yeah, sounds about right.
是的，听起来差不多。

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.400
Alright.
好的。

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.400
There they are.
他们在那儿。

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400
Got it.
明白了。

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.400
You're getting into a green Subaru. Run that plate.
你们要上一辆绿色的斯巴鲁。查一下那个车牌。

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.400
Okay, plates belong to a Tori Newell, 25. She lives in Clearville, Pennsylvania.
好的，车牌属于25岁的托里·纽厄尔。她住在宾夕法尼亚州的克利尔维尔。

Put a bottle out and let's get up on our phone.
放一个瓶子出来，我们开始监听电话。

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.400
I'll have Norbert arrested for aiding and abetting.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.400
Pack a small bag. We're going to Pennsylvania, my people.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.400
I was up until three in the morning. Kind of 14 tankers go by.
我昨晚一直熬到凌晨三点。大概有14辆油罐车经过。

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.400
When I looked up HENCEP gas and oil, I found this.
当我查找HENCEP天然气和石油时，我发现了这个。

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:37.400
They're building a pipeline for liquid CO2.
他们正在建设一条液态二氧化碳的管道。

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.400
I haven't seen any pipelines around here. What's it for?
我在这附近没见过任何管道。这是用来做什么的？

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.400
It's called carbon capture. They take all the byproducts and drill it and they pump them into the ground.
这叫做碳捕捉。他们收集所有的副产品，钻孔并将它们注入地下。

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.400
Supposedly a good thing, but the reason it's taken so long is this stuff is totally dangerous and bad for the environment.
据说这是件好事，但之所以花了这么长时间是因为这些东西非常危险，对环境有害。

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.400
Is that what's in those trucks?
那些卡车里装的就是这个吗？

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.400
I don't know.
我不知道。

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400
Well, where's the pipeline?
那么，管道在哪里？

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.400
Don't know that either. But I know how we could find out.
这个我也不知道。但我知道我们怎么才能找到答案。

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:19.400
[Music]

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.400
Hey. You okay?
嘿。你还好吗？

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.400
No, it's my ankle. I think it's broken. We were riding bikes and I fell off.
不好，是我的脚踝。我觉得它断了。我们刚才在骑自行车，我摔下来了。

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.400
Bikes? I don't see any.
自行车？我没看到啊。

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.400
What are you doing? You were not supposed to shoot him.
你在做什麼？你不該開槍打他的。

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.400
I didn't have a choice.
我別無選擇。

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.400
Oh my God, I think he's dead.
天啊，我覺得他死了。

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.400
We're all dying, Tori.
我們都會死的，托莉。

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.400
Hence that's been killing people with their poison for years.
多年來，他們一直用毒藥殺人。

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.400
You of all people should know that.
你應該比任何人都清楚這一點。

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.400
Come on! We gotta get out of here!
快點！我們得離開這裡！

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.400
And go where? We don't even know where the pipeline is now.
去哪裡？我們甚至不知道管線現在在哪裡。

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.400
He's got a GPS. We'll figure it out.
他有GPS，我們會找到的。

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.400

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400
Come on.
快點。

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:51.400
Hey. I've got an aerial here of Tori Newell's farmhouse.
嘿，我这里有托里·纽厄尔农舍的航拍图。

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.400
Looks like clear sightlines from any approach.
看起来从任何方向都有清晰的视线。

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.400
Yeah, except there on the south side. The topography may give us some cover.
是的，除了南边那里。地形可能会给我们一些掩护。

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.400
Reach out to troupas for backup.
联系特鲁帕斯请求支援。

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400
On it.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.400

好的，农舍位于马塞勒斯页岩上。大部分地产都是。

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.400
That land's been fract within an inch of its life.
那片土地已经被压裂得几乎无法再承受了。

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.400
Which is probably why Tori was so keen to help Trevor and Emma.
这可能就是为什么托里如此热衷于帮助特雷弗和艾玛。

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.400
They're on their way. Sorry, give me one minute.
他们正在路上。抱歉，给我一分钟。

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.400
Hey, Stuart. What's going on?
嘿，斯图尔特。发生什么事了？

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.400
I give up. Like I surrender.
我放弃了。就像我投降了。

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.400
Oh boy, what's happening?
哦，天哪，发生什么了？

You're dad. Like he won't let me pay for anything.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.400
He keeps trying to slip money into people's hands.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.400

Yeah, I mean that's just dad.

Yeah, well I mean more than that, he keeps smoking.

Like every 15 minutes we gotta stop so we can smoke.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.400
It's New York City. There's no place to smoke anymore.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.400
Can Tink help at all?
丁克能幫上忙嗎？

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.400
I mean she offered to take him to a matinee at the Lion King, but you know what?
我是說她提議帶他去看《獅子王》的日場演出，但你知道嗎？

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.400
She knows full well that they're gonna have to leave 10 minutes in,
她很清楚他們10分鐘後就得離開，

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.400
'cause he's gotta go smoke.
因為他得去抽煙。

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.400

We're on our way.
我們正在路上。
